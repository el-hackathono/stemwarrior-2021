            Disclaimer: These websites are not the websites they appear as.<br />
            (Ex) the Facebook phishing website is not facebook and is not
            affiliated with facebook in any way. <br />
            These websites will steal any information you input in them for
            educational purposes. <br />
            DO NOT INPUT YOUR ACTUAL EMAIL ADDRESS OR PASSWORD ON ANY OF THESE
            LINKS Make a spare email and spare accounts or use
            <a href="https://cryptogmail.com/">https://cryptogmail.com/</a> for
            a temporary email to use<br />
            <br />
            To test these phishing websites it is necessary to make a fake or
            alternate account before use<br />
            <br />
            The below Links are CLONES of popular websites and WILL STEAL YOUR
            EMAIL AND PASSWORD <br />
            THEY ARE NOT IN ANY AFFILIATION TO ANY OF THESE COMPANIES!
            <br />Once we obtain this information, we do not store it. The
            server code is open source.<br />
            <br />
            Any alternate links you press once on on the phishing site may
            reroute you to the actual website <br />
            A good way to tell if a link is a phishing website or not, is by
            simply looking at its URL <br />
            if the url contains <code>zadz-education.herokuapp.com</code>, then
            it is a component of the phishing website <br />
            if not then you may potentially have been routed to a legitimate
            website.
